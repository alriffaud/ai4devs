# System Documentation

This `system_documentation.md` provides a **comprehensive system documentation** for the legacy reporting tool, generated with AI assistance. It includes high-level **architecture**, **diagrams**, detailed **documentation** of **components**, **data flow**, and **interfaces**.

---

## 1. Architecture Overview

The legacy system is structured as a single Python module (`legacy_utils.py`), containing two primary classes and multiple helper functions. AI analysis identified the following architectural layers:

1. **Presentation/Report Layer**  
   - Responsible for rendering and saving reports.
2. **Business Logic Layer**  
   - Processes data aggregation and transformations.
3. **Data Access Layer**  
   - Manages database interactions and file I/O.
4. **Utility Layer**  
   - Common helper functions (date parsing, CSV/JSON handling).

Together, these layers form a monolithic application without strict separation, causing tight coupling and limited scalability.

---

## 2. Components

- **UserManager**  
  - Manages user creation and deletion.
  - Interfaces directly with the database connection.
- **ReportGenerator**  
  - Orchestrates report template loading, data aggregation, and report rendering.
- **Helper Functions**  
  - `process_data(records, options)`: filters, sorts, and transforms data.
  - `load_template(path)`: reads report templates from disk.
  - `save_report(content, path)`: writes formatted content to file.

## 3. Module Interaction Diagrams

### 3.1 System Architecture Diagram

```plain
+----------------+       +-----------------+       +---------------+
| UserManager    | <---> | Business Logic  | <---> | ReportGenerator |
+----------------+       +-----------------+       +---------------+
        |                     |                           |
        v                     v                           v
  Database I/O           Data Aggregation             Template Loading

```

### 3.2 Component Interaction Flow

```plain
[Client] -> UserManager.add_user() -> Database
     |
     -> ReportGenerator.generate_report() -> Helper Functions -> File System
```

## 4. Data Flow Documentation

Data flows through four main stages:

1. **Input Stage**  
   - Raw data arrives as JSON or CSV.
2. **Aggregation Stage**  
   - `generate_report()` groups and averages data.
3. **Transformation Stage**  
   - `process_data()` applies filters and status flags.
4. **Output Stage**  
   - Generated report is formatted and saved.

Each stage was validated against AI assumptions and actual code behavior to ensure accuracy.

---

## 5. Interfaces

- **Public Methods**  
  - `UserManager.add_user(user_data)`  
  - `UserManager.delete_user(user_id)`  
  - `ReportGenerator.generate_report(data_list, config)`
- **Configuration Interface**  
  - Expects `config` dictionary with keys:  
    - `template_path` (string)  
    - `output_path` (string)  
    - `group_by` (string key for aggregation)

---

## 6. API Documentation

Although this is a CLI/utility module, internal "API" to the functions is defined as:

| Function                        | Inputs                                          | Outputs               |
|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| `generate_report(data, config)` | `data` (list of dict), `config` (dict)          | `report` (string)     |
| `process_data(records, opts)`   | `records` (list of dict), `opts` (dict)         | `transformed` (list)  |
| `add_user(user_data)`           | `user_data` (dict with id, name, role)          | None                  |
| `delete_user(user_id)`          | `user_id` (string or int)                       | None                  |

## 7. Diagrams and Visuals

Below is an example of a **process flow chart** in ASCII:

```plain
[Start] -> Load Template -> Aggregate Data -> Compute Metrics -> Render Report -> Save File -> [End]
```

AI-generated UML-style diagrams were used to cross-validate these flows.

---

## 8. Validation Against Standards

- **WordPress**  
  - Emphasizes separate modules and hook-based architecture.
- **Rails**  
  - Uses MVC pattern and convention over configuration.

Our AI-assisted documentation highlights deviations and areas for modernization, suggesting a migration toward modular controllers and templates.

---

## 9. Future Recommendations

- Introduce dedicated modules for data access, business logic, and presentation.
- Replace hard-coded file paths with configuration files or environment variables.
- Add automated API documentation (e.g., Swagger) for any exposed interfaces.
- Adopt diagramming tools (e.g., PlantUML) to generate visual **diagrams**.
