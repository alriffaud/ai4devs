# Security Analysis

This **analysis** focuses on potential **security** vulnerabilities in the legacy code.

## Findings
- No input validation on file paths (path traversal risk).
- Use of `eval()` in data processing introduces code injection potential.
- Lack of secure defaults for file permissions.

## Recommendations
- Sanitize all user inputs.
- Replace `eval()` with safe parsing functions.
