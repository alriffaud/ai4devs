# Architecture Overview Analysis

This **analysis** document examines the **code structure** and architecture of the legacy codebase.

## Code Structure
- Monolithic single-file module with mixed concerns.
- No clear separation between data handling and presentation logic.

## Architecture Findings
- Lacks modular components: all functions and classes in one file.
- Tight coupling between `UserManager` and `ReportGenerator`.
- No use of design patterns (e.g., Factory, Strategy).
