# Performance Analysis

This **analysis** addresses **performance** issues in the legacy **code**.

## Issues Identified

- Nested loops in `process_records()` leading to O(n^2) behavior.
- Repeated database connections instead of pooling.

## Improvement Suggestions
- Use generators for file processing.
- Cache database connections.
