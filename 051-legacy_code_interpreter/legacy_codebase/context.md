# Legacy Code Context

This folder contains a single Python file (`legacy_utils.py`) that was developed in 2017 as part of an internal reporting tool.  

**Purpose:**  
- Provide utility functions and classes for reading input data (CSV, JSON), processing business logic, and generating formatted reports.

**Key Characteristics:**  
- Written by one developer, last maintained in 2018.  
- Minimal documentation and no automated tests.  
- Exhibits tight coupling and poor separation of concerns.

**Expectations:**  
- Main issues will include poor naming conventions, mixed responsibilities, and hardâ€‘coded configurations.  
- Total codebase size: approximately 350 lines in one file.
