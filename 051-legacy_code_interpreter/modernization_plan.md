# Modernization Plan

This **modernization_plan.md** outlines AI-driven **modernization opportunities**, **improvements**, and a **prioritized** roadmap for the legacy codebase. Each opportunity includes analysis of current limitations, **implementation** guidance, **complexity**, **risk**, and **value** estimation.

---

## 1. Replace File I/O with Configuration-Based Path Management

- **Opportunity:** Use structured configuration instead of hard-coded file paths.
- **Current Approach & Limitations:**  
  - Paths are embedded directly in code (`config['template_path']`), making relocation and environment changes error-prone.
- **Suggested Improvement:**  
  - Introduce a configuration loader (YAML or JSON) and use a central `Config` object.
- **Implementation (Pseudocode):**
  ```python
  class Config:
      def __init__(self, path):
          with open(path) as f:
              self.data = yaml.safe_load(f)
      def get(self, key):
          return self.data.get(key)
  ```
- **Risk:** Low – minimal code changes.
- **Complexity:** Low – single module update.
- **Value:** High – improves maintainability and environment portability.

## 2. Decouple Business Logic from I/O (Apply Dependency Injection)

- **Opportunity:** Separate data access logic from report generation.
- **Current Approach & Limitations:**  
  - `generate_report()` mixes file I/O, templating, and aggregation in one function.
- **Suggested Improvement:**  
  - Introduce services: `TemplateLoader`, `DataAggregator`, `ReportWriter`.
- **Implementation (Pseudocode):**
  ```python
  class ReportService:
      def __init__(self, loader, aggregator, writer):
          self.loader = loader
          self.aggregator = aggregator
          self.writer = writer

      def run(self, data, config):
          template = self.loader.load(config.template_path)
          summary = self.aggregator.aggregate(data, config.group_by)
          report = template.format(**summary)
          self.writer.write(report, config.output_path)
  ```
- **Risk:** Medium – requires refactoring function signatures.
- **Complexity:** Medium – affects multiple modules.
- **Value:** High – enhances testability and reduces coupling.

## 3. Introduce ORM for Database Access

- **Opportunity:** Replace raw SQL and cursor management with an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy).
- **Current Approach & Limitations:**  
  - Manual SQL increases vulnerability to injection; no transaction management.
- **Suggested Improvement:**  
  - Define models and use session-based commits.
- **Implementation (Pseudocode):**
  ```python
  class User(Base):
      __tablename__ = 'users'
      id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True)
      name = Column(String)
      role = Column(String)

  session.add(User(**user_data))
  session.commit()
  ```
- **Risk:** Medium – migration of data access layer.
- **Complexity:** Medium – new dependency and mapping.
- **Value:** High – improves security, readability, and maintainability.

---

## 4. Formalize Error Handling and Logging

- **Opportunity:** Implement structured logging and exception handling.
- **Current Approach & Limitations:**  
  - Silent failures or uncaught exceptions; no logs.
- **Suggested Improvement:**  
  - Integrate Python `logging` module and wrap critical sections in try/except.
- **Implementation (Pseudocode):**
  ```python
  import logging
  logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

  try:
      result = generate_report(data, config)
  except Exception as e:
      logger.error("Report generation failed", exc_info=e)
      raise
  ```
- **Risk:** Low – straightforward enhancements.
- **Complexity:** Low – limited to error-prone areas.
- **Value:** Medium – essential for troubleshooting and auditing.

---

## 5. Apply Asynchronous Processing for Large Data Sets

- **Opportunity:** Use `asyncio` or background job queues for expensive data processing.
- **Current Approach & Limitations:**  
  - Synchronous loops can block execution, leading to poor performance.
- **Suggested Improvement:**  
  - Convert aggregation to asynchronous tasks or batch jobs.
- **Implementation (Pseudocode):**
  ```python
  async def aggregate_async(data):
      loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
      return await loop.run_in_executor(None, aggregate_sync, data)
  ```
- **Risk:** High – threading/event loop considerations.
- **Complexity:** High – re-architect processing pipeline.
- **Value:** Medium – improved responsiveness for large inputs.
